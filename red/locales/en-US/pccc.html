	<p>Configures the connection to a PLC</p>
    <p>This node was created as part of the <a href="https://st-one.io" target="_blank">ST-One</a> project</p>

	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>
		The <b>Cycle time</b> configuration specifies the time interval in which
		all variables will be read from the PLC
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>Timeout</b> parameter sets the maximum amount of time that the PLC
		may take to answer our requests. It may be desirable to raise this time if
		the network is busy of it's latency is high
	</p>
	<p>
		You can check the <b>Use routing?</b> option it when routing is needed or
		when connecting to ControlLogix/CompactLogix controllers. A new field is
		shown where the routing EPATH can be configured. The value <code>[1,0]</code>
		routes to the slot 0 on the same backplane
	</p>

	<h3>Variable addressing</h3>
	<p>
		The variables and their addresses configured on the variable list should
		follow the same syntax as used on RSLogix 500, for example 
		<code>B3:0/0</code> or <code>F8:1</code>
	</p>

	<p>Reads data from a PLC</p>
    <p>This node was created as part of the <a href="https://st-one.io" target="_blank">ST-One</a> project</p>

	<h3>Outputs</h3>
	<dl class="message-properties">
		<dt>payload<span class="property-type">any</span></dt>
		<dd>
			The value(s) as read from the PLC. The format and type of the payload
			depends on the configured "Mode"
		</dd>

		<dt>topic<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
		<dd>
			The name of the variable, when the message refers to a single variable
			(that is, when mode is "Single Variable" or "All variables, one per
			message")
		</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>
		All data is read cyclically from the PLC as configured in the <i>pccc endpoint</i>, 
		but there are three modes of making it available in a flow:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Single variable:</b> A single variable can be selected from the configured 
			variables, and a message is sent every cycle, or only when it changes if 
			<i>diff</i> is checked. <code>msg.payload</code> contains the variable's value
			and <code>msg.topic</code> has the variable's name.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>All variables, one per message:</b> Like the <i>Single variable</i> mode, 
			but for all variables configured. If <i>diff</i> is checked, a message is sent
			everytime any variable changes. If <i>diff</i> is unchecked, one message is sent 
			for every variable, in every cycle. Care must be taken about the number of 
			messages per second in this mode.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>All variables:</b> In this mode, <code>msg.payload</code> contains an object 
			with all configured variables and their values. If <i>diff</i> is checked, a 
			message is sent if at least one of the variables changes its value.
		</li>
	</ul>

		<b>Caution when writing data to production PLCs!</b><br/>
		Fully test everything you do. The authors cannot be liable for any

	<h3>Inputs</h3>
	<dl class="message-properties">
		<dt>payload<span class="property-type">string | number | boolean | array</span></dt>
		<dd>
			the data to be written. It will be casted to the required data type
			whenever possible.
		</dd>
		
		<dt>variable<span class="property-type">string | array</span></dt>
		<dd>
			the variable to write to on the PLC, according to the variable list
			on the PLC endpoint. This takes effect <i>only</i> if the "Variable"
			field is left empty on the configuration.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>
		Writes data to the PLC on the variable specified on the node configuration
		or on <code>msg.variable</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is possible to write to multiple variables at once, by setting both 
		<code>msg.variable</code> and <code>msg.payload</code> to arrays containing 
		the variable names and their values, respectively. Note that they may not be
		written in the same write cycle to the PLC, depending on the amount of variables 
		to be written.
